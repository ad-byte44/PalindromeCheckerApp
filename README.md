# 📘 Palindrome Checker App

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Palindrome Checker App** is a console-based Java application designed to validate whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions.

This use case demonstrates the use of a **Stack** data structure to reverse characters and validate whether a string is a palindrome.

# 🚀 Use Case 5 (UC5): Stack-Based Palindrome Checker

## 🎯 Goal

Use a stack to reverse the characters of a string and validate whether it is a palindrome.

---

## 🔄 Flow

1. Program starts.
2. A string is defined.
3. Characters of the string are pushed into a stack.
4. Characters are popped from the stack (reversed order).
5. The reversed string is formed.
6. The original string is compared with the reversed string.
7. Result is printed.
8. Program exits.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

### 🔹 Stack
A linear data structure that follows the **Last In First Out (LIFO)** principle.

### 🔹 Push Operation
Used to insert characters into the stack.

### 🔹 Pop Operation
Used to remove characters from the stack in reverse order.

### 🔹 Reversal Logic
Since stack follows LIFO, it naturally reverses the order of elements.

### 🔹 equals() Method
Used to compare the actual content of two strings.

## 🗂️ Data Structure Used

### Stack

In this use case:
- `java.util.Stack` is used.
- Characters are pushed one by one.
- Popping elements gives reversed order.
