# 📘 Palindrome Checker App

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Palindrome Checker App** is a console-based Java application designed to validate whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions.

This project focuses on strengthening core Java fundamentals, understanding application structure, and building a foundation for data structure concepts.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this application is to:

- Understand Java program structure
- Implement the `main()` method correctly
- Practice console-based output
- Build a structured, scalable application
- Prepare for advanced palindrome validation logic

# 🚀 Use Case 1 (UC1): Application Entry & Welcome Message

### ✅ Goal
Display a welcome message and application details when the program starts.

### 👤 Actor
User

### 🔄 Flow
1. Program starts.
2. JVM invokes the `main()` method.
3. Application name is displayed.
4. Application version is displayed.
5. Program prepares for next use case.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- **Class** – Container for application logic.
- **Main Method** – Entry point of Java application.
- **Static Keyword** – Allows JVM to invoke `main()` without object creation.
- **Constants (`static final`)** – Used for application name and version.
- **Console Output** – `System.out.println()` used to display messages.
- **Application Flow Control** – Defines startup behavior.
