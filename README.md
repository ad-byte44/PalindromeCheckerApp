# 📘 Palindrome Checker App

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Palindrome Checker App** is a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome.

This project is designed to strengthen core Java programming fundamentals and basic data structure understanding using the `String` class.

# 🚀 Use Case 2 (UC2): Print a Hardcoded Palindrome Result

## 🎯 Goal
Display whether a hardcoded string is a palindrome.

## 👤 Actor
User

## 🔄 Flow

1. Program starts.
2. A hardcoded string is defined.
3. The string is reversed.
4. The original and reversed strings are compared.
5. The result is printed on the console.
6. Program exits.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- **Class** – Container that holds the program logic.
- **Main Method** – Entry point of Java application.
- **Static Keyword** – Allows JVM to call `main()` without object creation.
- **String** – Used to store textual data.
- **String Literal** – `"madam"` stored in the String constant pool.
- **For Loop** – Used to reverse the string.
- **Conditional Statement (if-else)** – Checks whether the string is a palindrome.
- **Console Output** – `System.out.println()` displays the result.

## 🗂️ Data Structure Used

### String

A `String` in Java is an immutable sequence of characters used to store and manipulate textual data.

In this use case:
- It stores the word to be checked.
- It is reversed manually using a loop.
- It is compared using the `equals()` method.
