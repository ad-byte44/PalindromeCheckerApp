# 📘 Palindrome Checker App

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Palindrome Checker App** is a console-based Java application designed to validate whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions.

This use case demonstrates a **recursive approach** to palindrome checking, strengthening understanding of recursion, base conditions, and the call stack mechanism.

# 🚀 Use Case 9 (UC9): Recursive Palindrome Checker

## 🎯 Goal

Check whether a string is a palindrome using recursion.

---

## 🔄 Flow

1. Program starts.
2. A string is defined.
3. Recursive method is called with start and end indices.
4. Characters at start and end are compared.
5. If they match, recursion continues inward.
6. Base condition stops recursion.
7. Result is displayed.
8. Program exits.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

### 🔹 Recursion

A programming technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.

Each recursive call reduces the problem size by moving inward.

---

### 🔹 Base Condition

The base condition prevents infinite recursion.
